## Spoils OF THE WASTE

You control the wealth of this world. 
because you are a

**KILLING MACHINE**

Take back what they have taken so far from humans and in the end humanity will rule again. Position the valuable loot correctly, avoid it from nuclear radiation to get a higher price to sell. Pay attention to objects that have elements. Here there are nuclear, bloom and flammable elements. nuclear elements can cause the price of the item to drop for sale, bloom can cause growth that takes up space, and flammable can cause items around it to get hot and cannot be moved, make sure you move the item first to move the surrounding objects.



Prepare and conquer!!!
